Extras*

Pod Name: Represents the name of each pod in the argocd namespace.
READY: Indicates how many containers in the pod are ready (e.g., 1/1 means 1 out of 1 container is ready).
STATUS: Shows the current state of the pod, e.g., Running means the pod is actively running.
RESTARTS: The number of times the pod has been restarted.
AGE: The time since the pod was created.

1. service:
- A service is a Kubernetes resource that defines how to access a set of pods, usually providing a stable endpoint for communication between components. 


Name: The name of the service.
Type: The type of service. Here, all services are of type ClusterIP, meaning they are only accessible from within the cluster.
Cluster-IP: The internal IP address assigned to the service.
External-IP: This is empty because the services are not exposed externally.
Port(s): The ports exposed by the service for internal communication.

for example:
argocd-server: The service that exposes the ArgoCD UI and API on ports 80 and 443.
argocd-repo-server: The service for the ArgoCD repository server, responsible for managing git repositories, exposed on ports 8081 and 8084.
argocd-dex-server: The service that handles authentication for ArgoCD using Dex.

2. deployment:
- A deployment is a Kubernetes resource that manages the lifecycle of a set of replicas (pods) to ensure that a specified number of identical pods are running.

Name: The name of the deployment.
Ready: The number of replicas that are running vs. the desired number of replicas (e.g., 1/1 means 1 out of 1 pod is running).
Up-to-date: The number of pods that are up-to-date with the deployment's configuration.
Available: The number of pods that are available to handle requests.
Age: The time since the deployment was created.

for example:
argocd-server: The deployment managing the ArgoCD server pods.
argocd-repo-server: The deployment managing the repository server.
argocd-redis: The deployment for Redis, used by ArgoCD for storing information.

3. ReplicaSet
- A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. The output lists the ReplicaSets associated with each deployment. They are automatically created when a deployment is created and are responsible for maintaining the desired number of pods.


Name: The name of the ReplicaSet.
Desired: The desired number of replicas (pods) for the ReplicaSet.
Current: The current number of pods managed by the ReplicaSet.
Ready: The number of pods that are ready and running.
Age: The time since the ReplicaSet was created.


4.  StatefulSets
A StatefulSet is a type of controller used to manage stateful applications. StatefulSets are useful for applications that require persistent storage and stable, unique network identities (like databases).

Name: The name of the StatefulSet.
Ready: The number of pods that are ready vs. the desired number.
Age: The time since the StatefulSet was created.



**Summary of Key Components in the argocd Namespace**
- Pods: The actual running instances of ArgoCD components.
- Services: Network endpoints that expose the ArgoCD components internally within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Deployments: The controllers that manage the creation and updates of the pods.
- ReplicaSets: Ensure that the correct number of pod replicas are running.
- StatefulSets: Specifically used for managing stateful applications (e.g., the application controller).

All of these components work together to deploy and manage the various services that make up the ArgoCD continuous delivery system within your Kubernetes cluster.
